# rgb_to_hex
My first ever "web" project which converts RGB value to hex.

Project contains 2 files: index.html and index.js

# index.html
Front-end html part showing text and input boxes.
To execute RBG to hex conversion, R, G and B values must be entered within the defined range. 
Out of range values will throw an error which can be checked in console. 

# index.js
Javascript file with 2 functions:
1. Validating input.
2. Converting each value to hex format.
